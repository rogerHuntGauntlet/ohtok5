For integrating an AI-powered movie review platform into your Flutter app, you can leverage open-source technologies with the following architecture:

Proposed Architecture
Frontend (Flutter App)

Built with Flutter for a cross-platform experience.
Uses Riverpod/Bloc for state management.
UI with Material 3 or custom psychedelic-themed design.
Backend (Node.js + Firebase + PostgreSQL)

Authentication: Firebase Auth for user authentication (Google, Apple, Email/Password).
Database:
Firebase Firestore for user-generated reviews and metadata.
PostgreSQL for structured data like movie details, ratings, and AI-generated insights.
Cloud Functions (Google Cloud Functions)
Hosts API endpoints for AI movie analysis and review generation.
Uses OpenAI (GPT-4) for review summaries and movie recommendations.
AI Processing (LangChain + Pinecone)

Vector Search: Pinecone to store and retrieve movie embeddings for personalized recommendations.
LLM Integration: LangChain + OpenAI API for generating contextualized reviews.
Sentiment Analysis: Hugging Face Transformers or OpenAI for analyzing user reviews.
Data Sources

Open-source movie databases like TMDb or OMDb for fetching movie metadata.
Wikipedia API for gathering additional movie context.
Hosting & Deployment

Backend: Deployed on Firebase Functions / Google Cloud Run.
Database: Firebase Firestore for NoSQL needs, PostgreSQL hosted on Supabase or Cloud SQL.
CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated deployments.
Next Steps
Select an open-source base (e.g., Letterboxd alternatives like LibreMovies or Telescope).
Define API contracts for fetching movie details, reviews, and recommendations.
Implement the AI pipeline for review generation.
